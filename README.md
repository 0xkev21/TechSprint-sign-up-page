# Sign Up Page
This is a Sign Up Form Layout built mainly with HTML and CSS.
I used a lot of input psudo-classes for this.

## About the Project
This is a project I created to complete **[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-sign-up-form)** Design to Code assignment.

This is my own solution. I wrote every line of codes on my own.
The page is fully responsive on small screens too.
